Calls the data from City of Chicago database that provides data for movies in the park

Finished on April 7 2020

Added manifest functionality 
Maps API coordinates with API Query
Markers can be removed via a button

Further Iterations improvements by priority:
1. Improve web app by rewritting as React.js
2. Refine API query to have logic for missing data (Maybe drop down buttons if I implement a service worker that gets the entire API data first. Will need to save the api data beforehand.)
3. Implement the checkbox to only search movies past todays date. (date logic has been set.)
4. Improve the "About Me" page, but with react and better spacing (maybe change my picture to a more recent one?)
